SIT-L is a software pipeline for robot situation learning, part of the [CONVINCE toolchain](https://convince-project.github.io/overview/). 
It implements a pipeline for learning new situations. Those situations are unexpected failures that may happen at design time. 
This procedure is directly related to [situation awareness](https://github.com/convince-project/sit-aw-aip), by tackling 
the detection, identification and mitigation of unknwon anomalies.

The module encapsulates situation awareness for detection and identification, added to it a 
learning procedure.
In the near future [WP3 active/simulate plan](https://github.com/convince-project/active-simulate-plan)
will be added to affine the learning. 

Refer to [sit-l](convince-project.github.io/sit-l/) documentation to learn how to get started and use it.
