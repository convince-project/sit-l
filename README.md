# sit-l

sit-l is a software pipeline for robot situation learning, part of the [CONVINCE toolchain](https://convince-project.github.io/overview/). It implements techniques for the acquisition (learning) of new episodic and semantic memory from encountered unexpected situations that were not foreseen at design time (unknown anomalies). It closes the loop of robot situation awareness and increased robot autonomy.

Below there is a list of the available software modules in the different releases of the sit-l pipeline. Each module is provided with documentation that contains a tutorial demonstrating the module functionality.

An overall tutorial on how to run the full pipeline on a coherent example will be added at a later stage of the project.
