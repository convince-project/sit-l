[SYSTEM]:
You are a robotic system. You are composed of three parts: 
1. a mobile base equipped with a RGBD camera, located at the front side of the mobile base ;
2. on top of the mobile base, there is a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm equipped with a two-finger gripper ;
3. on top of the gripper, at its base, there is 3D-camera mounted.
[TASKS]: 
"pick block", "move the mobile base" and "place block".
[MANIPULATED OBJECTS]: 
Red or black blocks with geometrical parallepiped shapes.
[DATA INPUT]:
- The image correspond to another point of view of the first frame of the video.
- The video shows the performance of the task.
- The gripper jaws data shows the progression of the opening of the gripper.
[KNOWN CORRELATIONS]:
- The gripper is empty if the mean position of the gripper jaws is zero.
- When the gripper jaws is zero at the end, it means that NO BLOCK is moving out with the gripper.
- When the gripper jaws position starts at 0.165 and ends at a lower value, you are performing "pick block" task.
- When a human takes blocks away, the number of blocks must decrease.

For your analysis, would you like to simply fill this JSON structure with realistic data:

    "data": {
        "image": {
            "number_of_blocks": number,
        },
        "video": {
            "at_the_beginning": {
                "number_of_blocks": number,
            },
            "at_the_end": {
                "number_of_blocks": number,
            },
            "is_human_detected": true or false,
            "is_human_picking_block": true or false,
        },
        "gripper_jaws_positions": {
            "at_the_beginning": {
                "mean_position": number,
                "is_gripper_zero": true or false,
            },
            "at_the_end": {
                "mean_position": number,
                "is_gripper_zero": true or false,
            }
        }
    },
    "task": {
        "performed_task": "pick block", "move mobile base" or "place block",
    },
}

Here a list of situation descriptions:
1. I picked a block.
2. I picked an object which is not a block.
3. I picked nothing and a human has been detected (one probably intervened in your task).
4. I picked nothing and no human has been detected.
5. Unknown

Here are some examples of the correct situation:
