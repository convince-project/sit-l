CONVINCE SIT-L, a software pipeline for robot situation learning
================================================================

SIT-L is a software pipeline for robot situation learning, part of the `CONVINCE toolchain`_. 
It implements a pipeline for learning new situations. Those situations are unexpected failures that may happen at design time. 
This procedure is directly related to `situation awareness`_, by tackling 
the detection, identification and mitigation of unknwon anomalies.

The module encapsulates situation awareness for detection and identification, added to it a 
learning procedure.
In the near future `WP3 active/simulate plan`_
will be added to affine the learning.
