CONVINCE SIT-L, a software pipeline for robot situation learning
================================================================

SIT-L is a software pipeline for robot situation learning, part of the `CONVINCE toolchain <https://convince-project.github.io/overview/>`_. 
It implements a pipeline for learning new situations. Those situations are unexpected failures that may happen at design time. 
This procedure is directly related to `situation awareness <https://github.com/convince-project/sit-aw-aip>`, by tackling 
the detection, identification and mitigation of unknwon anomalies.


The module encapsulates situation awareness for detection and identification, added to it a 
learning procedure.
In the near future `WP3 active/simulate plan <https://github.com/convince-project/active-simulate-plan>`
will be added to affine the learning.
