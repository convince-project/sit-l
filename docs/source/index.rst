CONVINCE SIT-L, a software pipeline for robot situation learning
================================================================

SIT-L is a software pipeline for robot situation learning, part of the `CONVINCE toolchain <https://convince-project.github.io/overview/>`_. It implements techniques for the acquisition (learning) of new episodic and semantic memory from encountered unexpected situations that were not foreseen at design time (unknown anomalies). It closes the loop of robot situation awareness and increased robot autonomy.

.. note::

   Description of general principes is coming soon.

The SIT-L pipeline is made up of several modules. Below there is a list of the modules available in the current release of SIT-L. Each module is provided with documentation that contains a tutorial demonstrating its functionality.

An overall tutorial on how to run the full pipeline on a coherent example will be added at a later stage of CONVINCE.

To be added
